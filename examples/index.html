    <p>
      <a href="https://www.github.com/firebase/geofire/">GeoFire</a> is an open-source JavaScript library
      that allows you to store and query a set of items based on their geographic location. GeoFire uses
      <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a> for data storage, allowing query results to be
      updated in realtime as they change. GeoFire does more than just measure the distance between locations;
      it selectively loads only the data near certain locations, keeping your applications light and responsive
      even with extremely large datasets.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./fish1/index.html">fish1 - Writing To and Reading From GeoFire</a></h2>

    <p>
      This is a very basic example which shows you how to read from and write to GeoFire
      and how to handle the promises returned by the set(), get(), and remove()
      methods.
    </p>

    <p>You can check out a live demo of this example <a href="./fish1/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="./fish2/index.html">fish2 - Using a GeoQuery</a></h2>

    <p>
      This is a more complex example which shows you how to create a GeoQuery and
      respond to keys moving into, out of, and within the query. It also shows how
      to cancel event callback registrations.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./fish3/index.html">fish3 - Loading Initial Data</a></h2>

    <p>
      This example shows you how to achieve a common use case: loading only initial
      data. This is accomplished in GeoFire by canceling a GeoQuery once its "ready"
      event has fired.

    <h2><a href="./html5Geolocation/index.html">html5Geolocation - HTML5 Geolocation API</a></h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html">HTML5 Geolocation API</a> allows you
      to get the current location of the person who is viewing your site. This demo shows
      how to use it to add their location to GeoFire. In addition, the examples uses
      Firebase's onDisconnect() method to remove their location from GeoFire when they
      leave the page (or close the app).
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./securityRules/rules.json">securityRules - Security Rules</a></h2>

    <p>
      This example is just a rules.json file which contains some security rules you
      can use for your GeoFire node. While this does help to enforce the schema of the data,
      it does not prevent a malicious user from scraping or overwriting your GeoFire data.
      You should replace all of the ".write" rules with some custom logic to restrict who
      can write to that node.
    </p>

    <p>You can check out the example rules.json file <a href="./securityRules/rules.json">here</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="./sfVehicles/index.html">sfVehicles - Fully-featured Example</a></h2>

    <p>
      This is a fully-featured, complex example which combines GeoFire, Google Maps,
      and the <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/data/real-time-transit-data.html">Firebase Transit Open Data Set</a>.
      Firebase provides a public Firebase which contains the realtime locations of public
      transit vehicles in several major US cities, including San Francisco MUNI. The data
      set also contains GeoFire data for each vehicle which we used to create this demo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drag around the purple circle to the left to see the vehicles which are currently within its radius. The
      results update in realtime as you move the circle and as vehicles travel around the city. GeoFire handles all
      of the hard work, telling you exactly when vehicles enter and exit the circle. It also selectively loads
      only the data geographically close to the circle, meaning GeoFire data for buses in New York or Chicago are not
      loaded into memory unnecessarily.
