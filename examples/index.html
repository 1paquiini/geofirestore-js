    <p>
      <a href="https://www.github.com/firebase/geofire/">GeoFire</a> is a JavaScript library that allows you to store and query a set
      of keys based on their geographic location. GeoFire uses <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>
      for data storage, allowing query results to be updated in realtime as they
      change. GeoFire does more than just measure the distance between locations;
      it selectively loads only the data near certain locations, keeping your
      applications light and responsive even with extremely large datasets.
    </p>

    <h2>fish1 - Writing To and Reading From GeoFire</h2>

    <p>
      This is a very basic example which shows you how to read from and write to GeoFire
      and how to handle the promises returned by the set(), get(), and remove()
      methods.
    </p>

    <p>You can check out a live demo of this example <a href="./fish1/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>fish2 - Using a GeoQuery</h2>

    <p>
      This is a more complex example which shows you how to create a GeoQuery and
      respond to keys moving into, out of, and within the query. It also shows how
      to cancel event callback registrations.
    </p>

    <h2>fish3 - Loading Initial Data</h2>

    <p>
      This example shows you how to achieve a common use case: loading only initial
      data. This is accomplished in GeoFire by canceling a GeoQuery once its "ready"
      event has fired.

    <h2>securityRules - Security Rules</h2>

    <p>
      This example is just a rules.json file which contains some security rules you
      can use for your GeoFire node. While this does help to enforce the schema of the data,
      it does not prevent a malicious user from scraping or overwriting your GeoFire data.
      You should replace all of the ".write" rules with some custom logic to restrict who
      can write to that node.
    </p>

    <h2>sfVehicles - Fully-featured Example</h2>

    <p>
      This is a fully-featured, complex example which combines GeoFire, Google Maps,
      and the <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/data/real-time-transit-data.html">Firebase Transit Open Data Set</a>.
      Firebase provides a public Firebase which contains transit data for dozens of
      cities in the United States. This data also includes a GeoFire index which is
      updated in realtime.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example uses GeoFire to map all of the vehicles in San Francisco within
      a certain radius. You can drag around the circle representing the circle and
      see the vehicles update in realtime. GeoFire allows to have a huge data set
      like this and only selectively load the data within your query, keeping the
      example light and responsive.
