# GeoFire â€” Realtime location queries with Firebase

GeoFire is a JavaScript library that allows you to store and query a set
of keys based on their geographic location. GeoFire uses Firebase for data
storage, allowing query results to be updated in realtime as they change.
GeoFire does more than just measure the distance between locations; it
selectively loads only the data near certain locations, keeping your
applications light and responsive.

## Downloading

In order to use GeoFire in your project, you need to include the following files in your HTML file:

```html
<!-- RSVP -->
<script src="rsvp.min.js"></script>

<!-- Firebase -->
<script src="firebase.min.js"></script>

<!-- GeoFire -->
<script src="geofire.min.js"></script>
```

You can find each of these files in the `/dest/` directory of this GitHub repository. For debugging purposes, there is also a non-minified `geofire.js` file in the `/dest/` directory.

You can also download all of these files via npm or Bower:

```bash
$ npm install rsvp firebase geofire --save-dev
```

```bash
$ bower install rsvp firebase geofire
```

## API Reference

### GeoFire

A `GeoFire` instance is used to read and write geolocation data to your Firebase. You can also use to it create `GeoQuery` objects.

#### new GeoFire(firebaseRef)

Returns a new `GeoFire` instance. The data for this `GeoFire` will be stored at your `firebaseRef` but will not overwrite all of your data at that location. Note that this `firebaseRef` can point to anywhere in your Firebase.

```JavaScript
// Create a Firebase reference where GeoFire will store its information
var dataRef = new Firebase("https://my-firebase.firebaseio-demo.com/");

// Create a GeoFire index
var geoFire = new GeoFire(dataRef);
```

#### GeoFire.set(key, location)

Adds the provided `key` - `location` pair to Firebase. Returns an empty promise which is fulfilled when the write is complete.

If the provided `key` already exists in this `GeoFire`, it will be overwritten with the new `location` value.

`location` must have the form `[latitude, longitude]`.

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.set("some_key", [37.79, -122.41]).then(function() {
  console.log("Provided key has been added to GeoFire");
}, function(error) {
  console.log("Error: " + error);
});
```

#### GeoFire.get(key)

Returns a promise fulfilled with the `location` corresponding to the provided `key`.

If the provided `key` does not exist, the returned promise is fulfilled with `null`.

The returned location will have the form `[latitude, longitude]`.

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.get("some_key").then(function(location) {
  if (location === null) {
    console.log("Provided key is not in GeoFire");
  }
  else {
    console.log("Provided key has a location of " + location);
  }
}, function(error) {
  console.log("Error: " + error);
});
```

#### GeoFire.remove(key)

Removes the provided `key` from this `GeoFire`. Returns an empty promise fulfilled when the `key` has been removed.

If the provided `key` is not in this `GeoFire`, the promise will still successfully resolve.

This is equivalent to calling `set(key, null)`.

`key` must be a string or number.

```JavaScript
geoFire.remove("some_key").then(function() {
  console.log("Provided key has been removed from GeoFire");
}, function(error) {
  console.log("Error: " + error);
});
```

#### GeoFire.query(queryCriteria)

Returns a new `GeoQuery` instance with the provided `queryCriteria`.

The `queryCriteria` describe a circular query and must be an associative array with the following keys:

* `center` - the center of this query, with the form `[latitude, longitude]`
* `radius` - the radius, in kilometers, from the center of this query in which to include results

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});
```

### GeoQuery

A standing query that tracks a set of keys matching a criteria. A new `GeoQuery` is returned every time you call `GeoFire.query()`.

#### GeoQuery.center()

Returns the `location` signifying the center of this query.

The returned `location` will have the form `[latitude, longitude]`.

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

var center = geoQuery.center();  // center === [10.38, 2.41]
```

#### GeoQuery.radius()

Returns the `radius` of this query, in kilometers.

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

var radius = geoQuery.radius();  // radius === 10.5
```

#### GeoQuery.updateCriteria(newQueryCriteria)

Updates the criteria for this query.

`newQueryCriteria` must be an associative array containing `center`, `radius`, or both.

```JavaScript
var geoQuery = geoFire.query({
  center: [10.38, 2.41],
  radius: 10.5
});

var center = geoQuery.center();  // center === [10.38, 2.41]
var radius = geoQuery.radius();  // radius === 10.5

geoQuery.updateCriteria({
  center: [-50.83, 100.19],
  radius: 5
});

center = geoQuery.center();  // center === [-50.83, 100.19]
radius = geoQuery.radius();  // radius === 5

geoQuery.updateCriteria({
  radius: 7
});

center = geoQuery.center();  // center === [-50.83, 100.19]
radius = geoQuery.radius();  // radius === 7
```

#### GeoQuery.on(eventType, callback)

Attaches a `callback` to this query which will be run when the provided `eventType` fires. Valid `eventType` values are `ready`, `key_entered`, `key_exited`, and `key_moved`. The `ready` event `callback` is passed no parameters. All other `callbacks` will be passed three parameters:

1. the location's key
2. the location's [latitude, longitude] pair
3. the distance, in kilometers, from the location to this query's center

`ready` is used to signify that this query has loaded its initial state and is up-to-date with its corresponding `GeoFire` instance. `ready` fires when this query has loaded all of the initial data from `GeoFire` and fired all other events for that data. It also fires every time `updateQuery()` is called, after all other events have fired for the updated query.

`key_entered` fires when a key enters this query. This can happen when a key moves from a location outside of this query to one inside of it or when a key is written to `GeoFire` for the first time and it falls within this query.

`key_exited` fires when a key moves from a location inside of this query to one outside of it. If the key was entirely removed from `GeoFire`, both the location and distance passed to the `callback` will be `null`.

`key_moved` fires when a key which is already in this query moves to another location inside of it.

Returns a `GeoCallbackRegistration` which can be used to cancel the `callback`. You can add as many callbacks as you would like for the same `eventType` by repeatedly calling `on()`. Each one will get called when its corresponding `eventType` fires. Each `callback` must be cancelled individually.

```JavaScript
var onReadyRegistration = geoQuery.on("ready", function() {
  console.log("GeoQuery has loaded and fired all other events for initial data");
});

var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");
});

var onKeyExitedRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_exited", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " exited query to " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");
});

var onKeyMovedRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_moved", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " moved within query to " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");
});
```

#### GeoQuery.cancel()

Terminates this query so that it no longer sends location updates. All callbacks attached to this query via `on()` will be cancelled. This query can no longer be used in the future.

```JavaScript
// This example stops listening for all key events in the query once the
// first key leaves the query

var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");
});

var onKeyExitedRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_exited", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " exited query to " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");

  // Cancel all of the query's callbacks
  geoQuery.cancel();
});
```

### GeoCallbackRegistration

An event registration which is used to cancel a `GeoQuery.on()` callback when it is no longer needed. A new `GeoCallbackRegistration` is returned every time you call `GeoQuery.on()`.

These are useful when you want to stop firing a callback for a certain `eventType` but do not want to cancel all of the query's event callback.

#### GeoCallbackRegistration.cancel()

Cancels this callback registration so that it no longer fires its callback. This has no effect on any other callback registrations you may have created.

```JavaScript
// This example stops listening for new keys entering the query once the
// first key leaves the query

var onKeyEnteredRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_entered", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " entered query at " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");
});

var onKeyExitedRegistration = geoQuery.on("key_exited", function(key, location, distance) {
  console.log(key + " exited query to " + location + " (" + distance + " km from center)");

  // Cancel the "key_entered" callback
  onKeyEnteredRegistration.cancel();
});
```

## Promises

GeoFire uses promises when writing and retrieving data. Promises represent the result of a potentially long-running operation and allow code to run asynchronously. Upon completion of the operation, the promise will be "resolved" / "fulfilled" with the operation's result. This result will be passed to the function defined in the promise's `then()` method.

GeoFire uses the lightweight [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/) library to provide an implementation of JavaScript promises. If you are unfamiliar with promises, please refer to the [RSVP.js documentation](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js/). Here is a quick example of how to consume a promise:

```JavaScript
promise.then(function(result) {
  console.log("Promise was successfully resolved with the following value: " + result);
}, function(error) {
  console.log("Promise was rejected with the following error: " + error);
})
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to GeoFire, you'll need to run the following
commands to get your environment set up.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/GeoFire.git
$ npm install    # install local npm build /test dependencies
$ bower install  # install local JavaScript dependencies
$ gulp serve     # watch for file changes and start server
```

`gulp serve` will watch for changes in the `/src/` directory and lint, concatenate, and minify the source files when a change occurs. It also starts a server running GeoFire at `http://localhost:6060`.

During development, you can run the test suite by navigating to `http://localhost:6060/tests/TestRunner.html` or run the tests via the command line using `gulp test`.
